The Layout
Android Studio is not showing the XML code itself here but rather a rendering of how the layout will appear on the screen. 
This is a visual editor a bit like Dreamweaver for web design and it makes life a little easier for us developers.

You also have a bunch of options called ‘widgets’ down the left that you can add to your app. 
This is your basic app stuff; so for instance, if you want to add a button saying ‘OK’ to your activity, you can simply drag it 
over to the screen and drop it anywhere you like.
Go ahead and dump an ‘OK’ button right underneath the ‘Hello World’.
