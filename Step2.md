Step 2: Setting Up Android Studio

Now you have Android Studio installed you’ve taken your first, bold step toward becoming a developer!
A lot of people only manage it this far and then leave the software installed on their computer for months on end, 
feeling guilty every time they see it in the Start Menu. 
Eventually they end deleting it to make space for the next AAA title on Steam and so ends the whole sorry affair… Don’t end up like them – 
it’s time for some more affirmative action!

Before you can get started, you also need to install Java on your machine to use Android Studio. 
Specifically, you’re going to need install the Java Development Kit (JDK).
Java is the programming language you’re going to be using to build your apps in this instance and
you need to install the JDK in order for Android Studio to be able to interpret and compile your code (compiling means turning the source into something that is understood by the CPU – machine code).
Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with
a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. 
The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager 
(Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, 
as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but
if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.
