Step 1: Download Android Studio

To program in most languages, you need a piece of software called an IDE or ‘Integrated Development Environment’. 
The most common IDE for Android development is Android Studio,
which comes direct from Google itself.You can get it here.
An IDE is what gives you the main UI where you’ll enter your code (you can’t just start typing into notepad).
It also highlights things you get wrong, offers suggestions and lets you run and test your creations conveniently.
It creates the files you need, it provides basic layouts and generally it saves you a lot of time and effort.
