Step 3: Starting a New Project

Once you’ve installed your samples, you can go back to the first page you saw when you loaded up Android Studio. 
Now you want to choose Start a new Android Studio Project – it’s finally happening!
Enter the name you want for your application and your ‘company domain’. 
Together these elements will be used to create your package name with the following format:

com.companyname.appname

The package will be the compiled file or APK (‘Android Package File’) that you’ll eventually upload to the Google Play Store. 
There are ways that people can see this, so if you’re planning on making something you’ll eventually release,
try to stay away from using ‘funny words’.
